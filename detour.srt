00:03:31,36 --> 00:03:34,90
first good piece played tonight you don't

21
00:03:34,91 --> 00:03:38,88
good taste. And.

22
00:03:50,72 --> 00:03:55,04
I was there always that rotten to. The
money around beating in my head never

23
00:03:55,05 --> 00:04:01,41
letting up. Did you ever
want to get anything

24
00:04:02,29 --> 00:04:03,70
did you ever want to cut away a P.C.

25
00:04:03,71 --> 00:04:09,82
a Memory or plan it out you can't and no
matter how hard you try you can change the

26
00:04:09,83 --> 00:04:13,92
scenery but sooner or later you'll get out
with a perfume with somebody will say

27
00:04:13,93 --> 00:04:20,79
a certain phrase or maybe hum
something. That you can't. Believe

28
00:04:20,80 --> 00:04:25,04
that you're in love with me I used
to love that song it's sort of

29
00:04:25,05 --> 00:04:29,05
a custom spec and you know break of
dawn of the New York I can't remember

30
00:04:29,06 --> 00:04:34,24
a night when I didn't get at least three
requests for him to. Sue She was always

31
00:04:34,25 --> 00:04:36,99
selling it to. Those were the things.

32
00:05:04,46 --> 00:05:11,42
You know this is to. Be. In

33
00:05:11,43 --> 00:05:14,91
love with. You.

34
00:05:18,63 --> 00:05:24,29
And your man who comes think.
You're in love with me.

35
00:05:28,21 --> 00:05:33,85
Always. I just.

36
00:05:39,40 --> 00:05:44,56
Have to. Think that. He was.

37
00:05:47,25 --> 00:05:48,25
In love with me.

38
00:05:57,36 --> 00:06:01,73
It wasn't much of a club really you know
the kind of joint where you could have

39
00:06:01,74 --> 00:06:02,40
a sandwich and

40
00:06:02,41 --> 00:06:08,77
a few drinks and run interference for your
girl on the dance floor. I wanted the

41
00:06:08,78 --> 00:06:12,72
piano in there every night from eight until
the place closed up which usually meant

42
00:06:12,73 --> 00:06:13,48
four in the morning

43
00:06:14,29 --> 00:06:22,05
a good job was jobs money
in those days. They

44
00:06:22,06 --> 00:06:27,64
were soon. Made working there and I don't
like working in heaven. But how we felt

45
00:06:27,65 --> 00:06:29,30
about each other well I was not

46
00:06:29,31 --> 00:06:33,67
a very unusual in that I was an ordinary
healthy guy and she was an ordinary

47
00:06:33,68 --> 00:06:36,58
healthy girl and when you add those two
together you get an ordinary healthy

48
00:06:36,59 --> 00:06:43,36
romance which is the old story sure but
somehow the most wonderful thing in the

49
00:06:43,37 --> 00:06:43,63
world.

50
00:06:52,13 --> 00:06:52,78
And I was

51
00:06:52,79 --> 00:07:03,96
a pretty lucky guy. Who

52
00:07:03,96 --> 00:07:07,57
. Just about

53
00:07:07,58 --> 00:07:13,66
a risky I'm sure it's beautiful you're
going to make kind of hard yeah yeah as

54
00:07:13,67 --> 00:07:19,06
a janitor I made my debut in the basement
of blame you for being bitter darling but

55
00:07:19,07 --> 00:07:24,40
you mustn't give up hope by some day yes
some day I don't get arthritis first I

56
00:07:24,41 --> 00:07:25,77
mean time let's blow this trap.

57
00:07:46,06 --> 00:07:50,66
Like to get somebody high on I don't think
so wow I lose my appetite for the day.

58
00:07:51,74 --> 00:07:58,47
It's gone OK. I can't stand much more of
that down did you see that drunk tonight

59
00:07:58,48 --> 00:08:04,81
trying to harm me now what wrong does it
matter what drowned. There was the matter

60
00:08:04,82 --> 00:08:08,43
with you tonight gone. That's the third
time you started to tell me something and

61
00:08:08,44 --> 00:08:13,29
stuff. We should have any secrets from each
other soon because we're going to make

62
00:08:13,30 --> 00:08:14,68
with a ring and a license
you and me will be

63
00:08:14,69 --> 00:08:20,55
a team Yes that's right in the bush league
I don't get you we've been struck out.

64
00:08:22,05 --> 00:08:22,14
It's

65
00:08:22,15 --> 00:08:27,73
a funny way to talk down but you want to
marry me now do you know I do and I want

66
00:08:27,74 --> 00:08:34,64
to marry you but but not now only
after we really good. Sunday I'm

67
00:08:34,65 --> 00:08:40,98
going away. On no you'll think it's silly
that's why hesitated to tell but I'm

68
00:08:40,99 --> 00:08:47,76
going to California I want to. That's the
most stupid thing I ever heard of don't

69
00:08:47,77 --> 00:08:50,14
you know millions of people go out there
every year and wind up publishing

70
00:08:50,15 --> 00:08:53,85
cuspidors I thought you had better sense
you sound as if you don't think I have any

71
00:08:53,86 --> 00:08:57,79
talent that has nothing to do with that
I'll make out all right maybe but what

72
00:08:57,80 --> 00:09:01,57
about me doesn't mean anything to you that
you're busting up all our plans we may

73
00:09:01,58 --> 00:09:07,47
not see each other for years and won't be
that long thought you love me. You know I

74
00:09:07,48 --> 00:09:12,93
do. Believe her.

75
00:09:18,28 --> 00:09:24,68
Can't you see my son and I'm young. And I
we've got all the time in the world to

76
00:09:24,69 --> 00:09:31,01
settle down. Really. What I'm
doing the only sane thing to do.

77
00:09:33,42 --> 00:09:38,06
I had thought of being so far away from
you but but we'll be together again some

78
00:09:38,07 --> 00:09:44,65
day. So long al.

79
00:09:45,94 --> 00:09:49,49
I want you going to kiss
me good night. Sure on

80
00:09:49,50 --> 00:09:53,13
a. Night.

81
00:11:38,22 --> 00:11:43,30
They rather get hit the jackpot
this time and Knox thanks for.

82
00:11:50,22 --> 00:11:51,20
One the strong candid me

83
00:11:51,21 --> 00:11:55,86
a ten spot after request I couldn't get
very excited What was it I and my family's

84
00:11:55,87 --> 00:12:01,17
a paper calling with germs couldn't
buy anything I wanted. Couldn't.

85
00:12:02,59 --> 00:12:08,54
Hold. And I thought of something. New.

86
00:12:29,80 --> 00:12:36,21
On distance I put a call to the Los
Angeles Miss RB Sue Harvey A.J.

87
00:12:36,22 --> 00:12:42,26
Are you why the numbers Crestview
six five seven two three Union.

88
00:12:44,57 --> 00:12:45,59
And unity.

89
00:13:02,39 --> 00:13:09,23
Continue to continue. A

90
00:13:09,24 --> 00:13:15,97
lawsuit this is out of baby it's great to
hear from you too much that you do need

91
00:13:15,98 --> 00:13:22,67
to dial and I thought I'd go batty without
you I just had to. Hear we're going to

92
00:13:22,68 --> 00:13:27,10
hash later she honey that's tough those
guys out in Hollywood don't know the real

93
00:13:27,11 --> 00:13:31,21
thing when it's right in front of them you
just stick it out Sue baby keep going

94
00:13:31,22 --> 00:13:38,22
around us casting offices I'm sure
your click. Out. Now don't try

95
00:13:38,23 --> 00:13:43,53
to stop me just expect me trained when I
was trained playing bus magic carpet I'll

96
00:13:43,54 --> 00:13:48,98
be there if I have to crawl back to
travel by pogo stick and then. Let's get

97
00:13:48,99 --> 00:13:55,49
married right away. That's the stuff
that's what I want to hear you say.

98
00:13:57,14 --> 00:14:01,91
Well goodbye for now.
I'll Be Seeing You sound.

99
00:14:03,95 --> 00:14:04,17
Yes.

100
00:14:12,33 --> 00:14:16,93
Way I could cross country from rides or
even after hiking everything out he had no

101
00:14:16,94 --> 00:14:23,32
money to eat. Money. You know what that
is. The stuff you never have enough

102
00:14:24,22 --> 00:14:27,86
little green things with George Washington's
picture that men slave for commit

103
00:14:27,87 --> 00:14:32,44
crimes people would die for. It's the
stuff that has caused more trouble in the

104
00:14:32,45 --> 00:14:36,47
world than anything else we haven't found
it simply because there's too little of

105
00:14:36,48 --> 00:14:41,19
it. At least I had too little
of it so it was me for the fun.

106
00:14:58,22 --> 00:15:04,05
Of it done any good strike and. It's not
much fun believe me. Oh yeah I know all

107
00:15:04,06 --> 00:15:06,05
about how it's an
education you get to meet

108
00:15:06,06 --> 00:15:11,88
a lot of people and all that but me from
now on I'll take my education in college

109
00:15:12,38 --> 00:15:14,26
or in P.S. Sixty two or us and I doubt

110
00:15:14,27 --> 00:15:26,31
a ninety eight stamps and
easy lessons. Coming

111
00:15:26,32 --> 00:15:32,16
rides may save your bus fare but it's
dangerous. You never know what's in store for

112
00:15:32,17 --> 00:15:38,21
you to the squeal of brakes. If only I had
known what I was getting into that day

113
00:15:38,22 --> 00:15:44,32
in Arizona. And found out
the back seat would be.

114
00:15:45,66 --> 00:15:50,55
OK let's go to that dark road. Near.

115
00:15:53,17 --> 00:15:55,41
Nothing to. Eat.

116
00:16:02,07 --> 00:16:04,33
You know Emily Post ought to
write a book of rules for

117
00:16:04,34 --> 00:16:09,01
a guy something rides because it is now
you never know what's right what's wrong.

118
00:16:10,38 --> 00:16:11,14
Road along for

119
00:16:11,15 --> 00:16:16,81
a little while neither one of the same. I
was glad of that. I never know what to

120
00:16:16,82 --> 00:16:21,81
say to strange people driving cars. Into
You can never tell if a guy wants to do

121
00:16:21,82 --> 00:16:24,84
a. Lot of rights have
been cut short because of

122
00:16:24,85 --> 00:16:30,74
a big. Deal so I kept my mouth
shut until he started opening up.

123
00:16:32,15 --> 00:16:38,80
At me that little box to go private
What about. All the way out with.

124
00:16:50,77 --> 00:16:52,32
A fire got L.A.

125
00:16:52,32 --> 00:16:56,47
. Really traveling out yeah but
I don't expect to make it for

126
00:16:56,48 --> 00:17:02,28
a couple of years at the rate I've been
on rides much like that here all bad not

127
00:17:02,29 --> 00:17:08,15
many people stop for a guy these days but
a stick up maybe they kept him up. By

128
00:17:08,16 --> 00:17:14,55
a gallon from New York. Or LA
This time I'm going all the way.

129
00:17:15,78 --> 00:17:18,91
Right through the Los Angeles. And drive

130
00:17:18,92 --> 00:17:25,89
a car sure I mean sorry let me
know. How. I guess at least

131
00:17:25,90 --> 00:17:30,40
an hour passed before I was those deep
scratches right and the world would get

132
00:17:30,41 --> 00:17:32,60
a free copy redlines about

133
00:17:32,61 --> 00:17:37,11
a quarter of an inch apart and. The most
obscene me looking at them because he said

134
00:17:37,11 --> 00:17:42,04
. Beauties are they. Going
to be skies someday.

135
00:17:44,22 --> 00:17:47,91
Want to know whatever it was it must have
been pretty big and vicious to have done

136
00:17:47,92 --> 00:17:53,04
that I don't vote because they are I was
tough for the most danger. Or is animal in

137
00:17:53,05 --> 00:18:00,00
the world a woman. Most men Tarzan's made
looks like a loss that. Certainly wasn't

138
00:18:00,01 --> 00:18:02,48
a draw. You know there are

139
00:18:02,49 --> 00:18:09,32
a veil or against things with or yeah
I just drove the car in. The wrong

140
00:18:10,27 --> 00:18:10,82
given left to

141
00:18:10,83 --> 00:18:16,40
a time I expected to be nice dodging. And
there are what kind of dames summarize

142
00:18:16,78 --> 00:18:23,78
Sunday school teachers. A little which.
Was I thought she was right with some

143
00:18:23,79 --> 00:18:29,84
fall guy. I mean it was my book the horses
around race tracks as I was twenty. And

144
00:18:29,85 --> 00:18:29,95
on

145
00:18:29,96 --> 00:18:37,03
a million things like. So
much to. Stop the car I open

146
00:18:37,04 --> 00:18:42,98
the door. Take it on the AH The Duffy
sister I told her the stuff as I was Donna.

147
00:18:45,02 --> 00:18:47,35
If you want to see a real scar rather get

148
00:18:47,36 --> 00:18:53,68
a load of this. Well. I got
that window of duelling.

149
00:18:54,78 --> 00:18:57,03
Yeah I just go in the course my dad on

150
00:18:57,04 --> 00:19:02,33
a couple of Franco-Prussian sabers got
to my door for the corrections. I wanted

151
00:19:02,34 --> 00:19:08,34
a lake at night took and no man
was around at the door. Get me on

152
00:19:08,35 --> 00:19:14,52
a. Pretty make. Faction set and
let it yeah I can see that

153
00:19:15,49 --> 00:19:16,67
now you know that box again where it.

154
00:19:29,73 --> 00:19:35,74
Pain made me lose my head I guess we get
slashed. Or I know it I put the other kids

155
00:19:35,74 --> 00:19:42,68
. And was tough I was just an axe
of course job kids I got scared

156
00:19:42,69 --> 00:19:46,80
this out I was going to run away from home.
Oh man I almost caught me when I was

157
00:19:46,81 --> 00:19:52,15
back in my dad's. Bloody rag I had wrapped
around my wrist and caught his attention

158
00:19:52,15 --> 00:19:59,13
. Dissing the bundle for sure. But I beat
it when he was fond of her Dr. I was very

159
00:19:59,21 --> 00:20:02,26
dense sixteen years ago and
I have been obsessively.

160
00:20:07,01 --> 00:20:09,65
But I'm never a bite of somebody a biters

161
00:20:09,66 --> 00:20:16,21
a. Brother was I mean I had never anything
in my stomach for hours to. Get even

162
00:20:16,22 --> 00:20:18,80
with that knowing in the pit of my
belly I didn't want to be in too big

163
00:20:18,81 --> 00:20:24,41
a rush to put on the big bag. First I had
to make sure this guy knew the score I

164
00:20:24,42 --> 00:20:29,98
got him down on me but by to get to
Hollywood. I wait on here for you Mr for some

165
00:20:29,99 --> 00:20:34,20
money don't worry about paying for this
Thomas on me and that's what Haskell make

166
00:20:34,21 --> 00:20:38,45
not another you make it first but maybe
you can do the same for me the money. I

167
00:20:38,46 --> 00:20:41,71
don't make the West Coast by Wednesday
the horse Funny and sad I need an entire

168
00:20:41,72 --> 00:20:47,44
bicycle means daughter me if I money will
make it all right. He did most of the

169
00:20:47,45 --> 00:20:53,51
talking during the half hour we were in
the place I date. He rambled on about his

170
00:20:53,52 --> 00:20:55,60
old man and we haven't heard
from since he ran away as

171
00:20:55,61 --> 00:20:57,48
a kid and now we happen to be from

172
00:20:57,49 --> 00:21:03,02
a bookie and all about how I got roped
in Miami one ranks thirty eight grand I

173
00:21:03,03 --> 00:21:07,61
cleaned out my park idea like that it was
tough luck and I'm supposed to be the

174
00:21:07,62 --> 00:21:11,71
smart guy you just wait I'm going back to
fire next season with all kinds of Jack

175
00:21:12,07 --> 00:21:16,50
and you watch the stink and I think
of it. When else and thanks I'm

176
00:21:16,51 --> 00:21:23,60
a tiny. Effect

177
00:21:23,61 --> 00:21:28,62
as just an. Oh just

178
00:21:28,63 --> 00:21:33,58
a minute or change the cable system I don't
think you said Colligan wait now side

179
00:21:33,62 --> 00:21:36,76
when you finish work. Shop check your.

180
00:21:42,91 --> 00:21:49,35
New law and drove all that night while
Haskell slept like a log. After

181
00:21:49,36 --> 00:21:56,06
a while I began the Gets with one
stone. I was happy. To not be with you

182
00:21:56,07 --> 00:22:00,15
again. A long trip was practically over
had been no more looking at down the

183
00:22:00,16 --> 00:22:06,01
concrete. I began to think of the future.
Which couldn't have been brighter but it

184
00:22:06,02 --> 00:22:09,97
brought it with me I. Was nice
to think soon shooting that.

185
00:22:13,20 --> 00:22:13,77
Amazing what

186
00:22:13,78 --> 00:22:21,84
a full belly can do the magic pace. Your

187
00:22:21,84 --> 00:22:27,02
. Own you. Could.

188
00:22:29,20 --> 00:22:32,62
Be in. Love with.

189
00:22:44,19 --> 00:22:50,12
A shoe. And. In law we.

190
00:22:53,28 --> 00:22:56,44
Meet.

191
00:23:07,33 --> 00:23:10,75
Mr Haskell. Mr has called.

192
00:23:14,22 --> 00:23:17,38
To ask for a wake up training
which I got to stop at

193
00:23:17,39 --> 00:23:27,58
a top. Star

194
00:23:27,59 --> 00:23:28,94
cast one of the top.

195
00:23:37,29 --> 00:23:44,22
To the. Top

196
00:23:44,37 --> 00:23:47,74
at them thanks Mark. But from
then on something else stepped in

197
00:23:47,75 --> 00:23:48,62
a shot of me off to

198
00:23:48,63 --> 00:23:58,81
a different destination. I
pulled open that door. Perhaps

199
00:23:58,82 --> 00:24:05,18
what's the matter are you hurt.
Or you hurt Mr Haskell. Starters.

200
00:24:06,21 --> 00:24:09,94
I listen to it but I know what you're
going to hand even before you open your

201
00:24:09,95 --> 00:24:13,97
mouths you're going to tell me you don't
believe my story of how his go died and to

202
00:24:13,98 --> 00:24:20,94
me that don't make me laugh
expression and yes my face as. I saw

203
00:24:20,95 --> 00:24:23,21
it once was yes I was in for

204
00:24:23,22 --> 00:24:27,26
a good believe he fell out of the car
might have spoken too which of course he

205
00:24:27,27 --> 00:24:30,68
couldn't even he was where I come to
move the head for his dog Yes I was an.

206
00:24:32,84 --> 00:24:36,51
Instinct told me to run but then I realized
it was hopeless so lots of people back

207
00:24:36,52 --> 00:24:40,70
down the road at identifying that gas
station guy and we were going to war spot

208
00:24:40,71 --> 00:24:44,89
them trying to explain why and beat it. The
next possibly was to sit tight and tell

209
00:24:44,90 --> 00:24:49,49
the truth from the cops but it would be
crazy he'd laugh at the truth and I had my

210
00:24:49,50 --> 00:24:49,66
head in

211
00:24:49,67 --> 00:24:55,95
a noose. So what else was I to do but
hide the body and get away the car could

212
00:24:55,96 --> 00:24:58,83
leave the car there with him in the
gully it would be like a wrecking

213
00:24:58,84 --> 00:25:28,57
a tombstone. My

214
00:25:28,58 --> 00:25:32,57
idea was to come in with fresh pot to rob
it but then I remember that even if I

215
00:25:32,58 --> 00:25:33,37
only drove the car for

216
00:25:33,38 --> 00:25:38,50
a hundred miles or so I would need money
for gas. Besides it was stupid of me to

217
00:25:38,51 --> 00:25:42,08
leave all that money
and. Not only that but

218
00:25:42,09 --> 00:25:47,49
a take his driver's license because I was
stuck for something. I'd like to think of

219
00:25:48,14 --> 00:25:51,34
about that time I'd done just what the
police would say I did even if I didn't.

220
00:25:52,90 --> 00:25:58,92
Michaels The owner of such an expensive
car will never be worth. Me suspicious.

221
00:26:24,77 --> 00:26:27,58
To you this your car but
you know better to leave

222
00:26:27,59 --> 00:26:30,96
a car without wheels halfway in the middle
the road that's the way accidents happen

223
00:26:31,45 --> 00:26:37,44
I'm sorry officer I'm just putting up my
top I think and the next time think I'll

224
00:26:37,45 --> 00:26:41,28
let you go now to watch your step in the
future I know that alone is great but cars

225
00:26:41,29 --> 00:26:44,68
going by routes and while we
have plenty I can. Think.

226
00:27:09,04 --> 00:27:13,21
Of nothing particularly as right as
they found a dead man on the go and not

227
00:27:13,68 --> 00:27:14,14
a bit me.

228
00:27:22,98 --> 00:27:28,05
As I drove off it still raining. And the
drop straight down the windshield like to

229
00:27:28,06 --> 00:27:34,51
hear. I kept imagining I was being followed
but I could hear sirens back in the

230
00:27:34,52 --> 00:27:39,43
distance. Just how long it took me to cover
the sixty five miles to the California

231
00:27:39,44 --> 00:27:45,21
state line I don't know I lost all track
of time but the rain had stopped and the

232
00:27:45,22 --> 00:27:47,79
sun was up my specs stick to.

233
00:27:54,39 --> 00:28:01,00
Carrying any groups of vegetables any
livestock or poultry. I see your

234
00:28:01,01 --> 00:28:07,99
registration driver's
license is. Anything in

235
00:28:08,00 --> 00:28:14,70
the baggage compartment as baggage. Charles
Haskell Jr age thirty brown eyes dark

236
00:28:14,74 --> 00:28:15,66
hair and

237
00:28:15,67 --> 00:28:21,51
a fine marksman on you child has told union
yes I remember employing you stay over

238
00:28:21,52 --> 00:28:25,31
thirty days or take out California plates
all right off the ground in the state

239
00:28:25,32 --> 00:28:28,74
a short while. Like you done on.

240
00:28:32,86 --> 00:28:34,46
T.V.

241
00:28:34,46 --> 00:28:41,25
. But drive any bottling up some speed
ups and no cops I know I had to get

242
00:28:41,26 --> 00:28:41,49
back

243
00:28:41,50 --> 00:28:53,09
a kid at heart. I was dead tired. All

244
00:28:53,09 --> 00:28:53,09
.

245
00:29:03,91 --> 00:29:09,45
Going to them in the. Morning and.

246
00:29:18,52 --> 00:29:21,28
Are You can then ask. No.

247
00:29:26,08 --> 00:29:31,84
And. Then ask. You and.

248
00:29:33,46 --> 00:29:38,74
I'm going. To die I didn't.
Know what was going to ask.

249
00:29:47,33 --> 00:29:49,08
Me anything.

250
00:29:55,07 --> 00:30:01,09
Newt Gingrich was there and it made
Can I come in and clean. Later.

251
00:30:02,18 --> 00:30:02,27
In

252
00:30:02,28 --> 00:30:12,87
a half hour all right. In

253
00:30:12,88 --> 00:30:12,96
that.

254
00:30:29,03 --> 00:30:32,84
There was no time to lose and every minute
I had to be trials Haskell was dangerous

255
00:30:33,23 --> 00:30:36,02
not have to be trials has to go until I
got to some city where I could leave the

256
00:30:36,03 --> 00:30:38,90
car and be swallowed up. And.

257
00:30:43,10 --> 00:30:47,53
That meant driving the car as far as San
Bernardino maybe even to Los Angeles in

258
00:30:47,54 --> 00:30:49,57
a little town I might be noticed but in

259
00:30:49,58 --> 00:30:55,23
a city I should be safe and. Then after I
ditched the car I could go on the SUV.

260
00:30:56,41 --> 00:30:59,78
But those five minutes at the state
line made me realize it might be

261
00:30:59,79 --> 00:31:00,81
a good idea to find out

262
00:31:00,82 --> 00:31:05,28
a little bit about Mr Hess. And if anybody
asked me questions I could give the

263
00:31:05,29 --> 00:31:09,92
right answers. The first thing I found out
was that I had seven hundred sixty eight

264
00:31:09,93 --> 00:31:14,84
dollars This was a lot of
jack but believe me it was

265
00:31:14,85 --> 00:31:16,51
a kind of money I'd rather not have.

266
00:31:24,34 --> 00:31:25,38
And then I found out from

267
00:31:25,39 --> 00:31:29,28
a letter Haskell was carting around in
his bag that he wasn't the open hand and

268
00:31:29,29 --> 00:31:34,38
easygoing big shot went around buying dinners
for strange hitchhikers before I got

269
00:31:34,39 --> 00:31:35,85
done reading and I saw him more as

270
00:31:35,86 --> 00:31:41,63
a chess player. It was written to his old
man in California one he hadn't seen in

271
00:31:41,64 --> 00:31:44,55
so many. In it Haskell posed as

272
00:31:44,56 --> 00:31:51,41
a salesman of hymnals of all things. It
was easy to see where Haskell expected to

273
00:31:51,42 --> 00:31:51,68
raise

274
00:31:51,69 --> 00:31:58,75
a new stake for. Spoken Miami. Iraq in
years old man. That was about all I found

275
00:31:58,76 --> 00:32:05,08
out from his affects and it was enough.
I told myself maybe oh man Haskell was

276
00:32:05,09 --> 00:32:10,57
lucky his son kicked off. He would never
know it but it saved him from taking

277
00:32:10,58 --> 00:32:12,03
a flyer and sacred literature

278
00:32:12,04 --> 00:32:38,27
a preferred. New

279
00:32:38,28 --> 00:32:42,80
York want to desert center up
holed up for water. There was

280
00:32:42,81 --> 00:32:49,80
a woman. A year oh come on if you want to

281
00:32:49,81 --> 00:32:50,24
ride.

282
00:33:36,88 --> 00:33:43,41
A bike on. My own. That took me by
surprise I turned my head the room.

283
00:33:44,82 --> 00:33:49,68
Was pacing straight ahead so I could see
her eyes she was young and more than

284
00:33:49,69 --> 00:33:50,34
twenty four

285
00:33:50,35 --> 00:33:55,12
a. Man she had. As if she'd just been thrown
off the rummiest freight train in the

286
00:33:55,13 --> 00:34:01,21
world. And yet in spite of this I got the
impression of beauty. Not the beauty of

287
00:34:01,22 --> 00:34:04,96
a movie actress mind you or the beauty you
dream about when you're with your wife

288
00:34:05,61 --> 00:34:05,72
but

289
00:34:05,73 --> 00:34:12,84
a natural beauty of beauty that's almost
homey because it's story. Then suddenly

290
00:34:12,85 --> 00:34:15,23
she turned to face me I'm hard to take on

291
00:34:16,12 --> 00:34:22,94
a sensuous telling. Allies but
not from the best. But you

292
00:34:22,95 --> 00:34:28,99
say Oh nothing just thinking out loud
people get in trouble for telling that. But

293
00:34:29,00 --> 00:34:35,99
your name in the comic they're asking
why. You live in Los Angeles now. Where

294
00:34:36,00 --> 00:34:42,93
I come from back there. Now.
Oh sure Phoenix you know just

295
00:34:42,94 --> 00:34:43,08
like

296
00:34:43,09 --> 00:34:48,17
a phoenix girl and the girls clinics that
band The girl must have been pretty tired

297
00:34:48,72 --> 00:34:52,86
because you probably sleep not twenty
minutes you're stuck in the car. You know

298
00:34:52,87 --> 00:34:57,76
sprawled out with your head resting against
the car door like past I don't like

299
00:34:57,77 --> 00:35:04,68
that much I didn't wake her up. And wasn't
this girl still worried. I'd gotten

300
00:35:04,69 --> 00:35:08,69
over that funny feeling out here she
looked which I wouldn't doubt it's just my

301
00:35:08,70 --> 00:35:14,04
jangled nerves but their eyes were
closed as the snot out of. You seemed.

302
00:35:15,75 --> 00:35:20,75
And instead of disliking there I began to
feel sorry for. The poor kid probably had

303
00:35:20,76 --> 00:35:20,92
had

304
00:35:20,93 --> 00:35:27,85
a rough time of it. Was she anyway. Why
was she going to Los Angeles when she

305
00:35:27,86 --> 00:35:33,32
come from the first place the only thing I
knew about it was her name. And that any

306
00:35:33,33 --> 00:35:38,13
difference few hours more would be and how
if I forget where I parked the car and

307
00:35:38,14 --> 00:35:40,86
look up so. This nightmare of being

308
00:35:40,87 --> 00:35:46,23
a dead man would be over. This day as well
it was no business of mine where did you

309
00:35:46,24 --> 00:35:52,31
leave this body and brain to leave the owner
of this car yet not to let anyone just

310
00:35:52,32 --> 00:35:52,97
by. Belongs to

311
00:35:52,98 --> 00:35:57,47
a guy name ASCO that's not you Mr Here are
your mind that's my name trials Masco I

312
00:35:57,48 --> 00:36:01,22
can prove it is my driver's name is not
the problem I still haven't asked as well

313
00:36:01,23 --> 00:36:05,46
it only makes it worse it just so happens
I wrote that Charlie has come all the way

314
00:36:05,47 --> 00:36:11,59
from Louisiana he picked me up outside of
St for you Road gardening and it all came

315
00:36:11,60 --> 00:36:17,37
back to. All the talk about doing scars
and scratches. It was no doubt about it

316
00:36:18,32 --> 00:36:22,38
girl must be the woman has to have mentioned
she must have passed me while I slept

317
00:36:22,75 --> 00:36:28,31
well and. Well I'm waiting I
guess was could. She have.

318
00:36:29,78 --> 00:36:32,36
That Haskell guy wasn't dead yet. He was

319
00:36:32,37 --> 00:36:36,12
a stretched out stiff and cold in any Arizona
golly you were sitting right there in

320
00:36:36,13 --> 00:36:41,94
the crowd laughing like mad while the
heart of me. Down there was nothing our

321
00:36:41,95 --> 00:36:48,74
concern. Was her. Hero whatever name was
it was just my luck picking her up on the

322
00:36:48,75 --> 00:36:54,89
road. Couldn't have been Helen Mary or
Evelyn or Ruth. And had to be the very last

323
00:36:54,90 --> 00:37:01,28
person I should ever met. That's why.
Whichever way you turn fate sticks out

324
00:37:01,29 --> 00:37:08,25
a quick trip. I told

325
00:37:08,26 --> 00:37:12,36
her everything but she didn't believe my
story I should have saved my breath that's

326
00:37:12,37 --> 00:37:17,19
my greatest couple story I ever heard so
he fell out of his car safely I think and

327
00:37:17,20 --> 00:37:18,65
talk until I make this

328
00:37:18,66 --> 00:37:23,17
a misstep I've been around and I know
wrong guy when I see one but you do it

329
00:37:23,18 --> 00:37:24,54
because I'm with the wrench Now wait

330
00:37:24,55 --> 00:37:28,26
a minute what I told you was true you see
that's what I have to do and you think I

331
00:37:28,27 --> 00:37:31,58
killed him well the cops would have thought
so too yeah well maybe they still think

332
00:37:31,59 --> 00:37:37,10
so. But makes you so sure I'll shut
up about this girl I'm innocent gimme

333
00:37:37,11 --> 00:37:42,32
a break where you left the won't do me any
good having eventually the cops are no

334
00:37:42,33 --> 00:37:44,43
friends of mine now that was

335
00:37:44,44 --> 00:37:50,10
a reward but the resident things don't
thank me yet I'm not through with you by

336
00:37:50,11 --> 00:37:52,41
a long shot let's see that grown.

337
00:37:59,25 --> 00:38:03,26
Because I DON'T HAVE TO GO THERE IS NO NO
NO I thought he had more of that I don't

338
00:38:03,27 --> 00:38:07,57
know if you can search we've been told not
and well maybe I will let that he told

339
00:38:07,58 --> 00:38:09,15
me it was NOT about three
thousand dollars on

340
00:38:09,16 --> 00:38:12,98
a horse named Paradise o'clock on Wednesday
at Santa Anita it was for your long

341
00:38:12,99 --> 00:38:16,77
about three hundred maybe two or three
books three hundred was a piece of cheese

342
00:38:16,78 --> 00:38:17,91
a big girl less than

343
00:38:17,92 --> 00:38:21,73
a mystic don't try and tell me anything
about Charlie Haskell remember I know him

344
00:38:21,74 --> 00:38:24,51
better than you do OK that you knew
he was a four flusher that explains

345
00:38:24,52 --> 00:38:28,29
a three grand bet I'm not so sure he
didn't have that three grand Why should I

346
00:38:28,30 --> 00:38:31,83
believe you you got all the
earmarks of a cheap crook Now wait

347
00:38:31,84 --> 00:38:36,08
a minute you're at cheap cooking it killed
him but two cents I change my mind and

348
00:38:36,09 --> 00:38:40,94
tourney and I don't like to write or I
don't get so I'm not getting so I just

349
00:38:40,95 --> 00:38:44,34
remember who's boss around here if you
shut up and don't give me any arguments

350
00:38:44,44 --> 00:38:48,47
you'll have nothing to worry about but if
you act wise Well Mr you'll stop at the

351
00:38:48,48 --> 00:38:52,70
jail so fast it'll give you the pains
not arguably that you don't you know as

352
00:38:52,71 --> 00:38:54,42
crooked as you were luck I'd hate to see

353
00:38:54,43 --> 00:38:57,96
a fellow as young as you wind up sniffing
that perfume that Arizona hands out

354
00:38:58,04 --> 00:38:59,08
played a murderous I'm not

355
00:38:59,09 --> 00:39:03,27
a murderer I'm car share not ASCO not going
at all you're allowed to have just like

356
00:39:03,28 --> 00:39:07,10
I told you many make your friends not his
belongings I explained what I was told it

357
00:39:07,69 --> 00:39:09,61
doesn't make a difference
one way or another I'm not

358
00:39:09,62 --> 00:39:14,33
a morning I like Tesco even less
than I like you here I started to do

359
00:39:14,34 --> 00:39:20,07
a what do you mean scratches on his
wrist sure I scratched him. So you did.

360
00:39:21,39 --> 00:39:23,19
So your idea was to drive the car

361
00:39:23,20 --> 00:39:28,16
a little way maybe into San Bernadino then
leaving Iraq going to sell it so what

362
00:39:28,69 --> 00:39:32,57
you think I'm crazy somebody else's car
here I want to do is leave it somewhere and

363
00:39:32,58 --> 00:39:34,51
forget I ever saw it not
only don't you have

364
00:39:34,52 --> 00:39:38,13
a screw but you don't have any
brains I don't get you maybe it's

365
00:39:38,14 --> 00:39:42,64
a good thing you met me good it got yourself
caught sure why you don't don't you

366
00:39:42,65 --> 00:39:48,95
know what deserted automobile always writes
an investigation. The cops find it then

367
00:39:48,96 --> 00:39:53,69
they get curious they wonder where the
owner is so are. They don't trace Haskel

368
00:39:54,07 --> 00:39:58,71
they trace shield I never thought of that
the only same way to get rid of the cars

369
00:39:58,72 --> 00:39:59,19
to sell it to

370
00:39:59,20 --> 00:40:03,78
a dealer get registered on our new name
say stop at the next store I want to get

371
00:40:03,79 --> 00:40:07,61
a bottle and do some shopping before
we get out like OK if you find

372
00:40:07,62 --> 00:40:11,32
a place I'll drop you off and pick up later
not the dough and you're coming in to

373
00:40:11,80 --> 00:40:16,61
from now on you and I like to sign these
twenty but your way I don't get the point

374
00:40:16,87 --> 00:40:20,23
the point is I don't want you to get lost
I'm not going to beat about what you're

375
00:40:20,24 --> 00:40:23,98
afraid of say you're not going to say
that you sell this car so you don't get

376
00:40:23,99 --> 00:40:29,67
caught banks course your interest would
be financial what you would want to small

377
00:40:29,68 --> 00:40:34,69
percentage of the profits Well now that
you insist on going are if you know one

378
00:40:34,70 --> 00:40:38,71
hundred percent will do fine
I'm relieved I thought for

379
00:40:38,72 --> 00:40:41,56
a moment you're going to take it
all right I want to be a home

380
00:40:41,57 --> 00:40:48,12
a. Few Hours later we were in Hollywood and
I was recognizing places Seward written

381
00:40:48,13 --> 00:40:52,61
about it struck me that far from being
at the end of the trip there was

382
00:40:52,62 --> 00:40:57,35
a greater distance between Sue and me
than when I started out. Here I wasn't

383
00:40:57,36 --> 00:41:00,42
kidding with that Siamese
twins Greg she rented

384
00:41:00,43 --> 00:41:06,13
a little apartment as Mrs Charles Haskell.
And I objected to this she explained it

385
00:41:06,14 --> 00:41:10,31
was on account of the car dealer might
think something was funny because I'm from

386
00:41:10,32 --> 00:41:11,65
her using different names.

387
00:41:17,09 --> 00:41:20,53
Oh sweet home you know. Not bad either.

388
00:41:28,72 --> 00:41:29,23
Case isn't

389
00:41:29,24 --> 00:41:40,66
a doubt in your mind I'll take the bet
you know. There is stuff here. To

390
00:41:40,66 --> 00:41:47,58
. Keep the one to shut OK you know

391
00:41:47,59 --> 00:41:48,98

392
00:41:48,99 --> 00:41:57,04
a fall of it behind us dollars. In

00:41:57,05 --> 00:42:02,48

why but I figured you would be.

396
00:42:29,29 --> 00:42:35,37
Boiled Boy you sure feels good to be clean
again. I must be ten pounds lighter.

397
00:42:36,76 --> 00:42:40,99
You must be. Moments arrives

398
00:42:41,00 --> 00:42:47,80
a keeper schooled on the election.
In the wish that guy with the

399
00:42:47,81 --> 00:42:50,66
sex would give up. Its I'm

400
00:42:50,67 --> 00:42:57,67

cops. Such era get rid of that long puss.

that's right Africa I guess I'm getting

486
00:51:31,88 --> 00:51:37,42
kind of used to you. That's ahead but you
can start break and try this place in the

487
00:51:37,43 --> 00:51:37,93
middle of Block.

488
00:51:45,26 --> 00:51:48,04
You know if you know what kind of
lawyer we're interested in selling

489
00:51:48,05 --> 00:51:54,99
a car if the price is right. Well if it's
in good mechanical condition it should be

490
00:51:55,12 --> 00:51:58,40
both robot sixteen hundred. Twenty take

491
00:51:58,41 --> 00:52:01,53
a look at this motor sixteen
hundred Are you kidding me.

492
00:52:11,86 --> 00:52:16,55
It's. Well maybe eight hundred fifty four
I let it go for eight hundred fifty Cal

493
00:52:16,56 --> 00:52:23,30
Ripken collect the insurance
for it. If. I do this

494
00:52:23,31 --> 00:52:23,75
forcing

495
00:52:23,76 --> 00:52:31,59
a lot of drive. Around

496
00:52:31,60 --> 00:52:37,05
the mechanic inspected the car we had.
Last year we were all worn out we had

497
00:52:37,06 --> 00:52:43,82
a compromise his price. OK it's

498
00:52:43,83 --> 00:52:47,49
a deal I can I will sign the papers I have
the ownership papers right here with me

499
00:52:48,17 --> 00:52:51,54
Look here in the meantime we've seen a
day's compartment and maybe some stuff in

500
00:52:51,55 --> 00:52:58,27
a right wing. Eight thousand
nine hundred sixty box that

501
00:52:58,40 --> 00:52:58,75
dirty.

502
00:53:07,20 --> 00:53:13,26
New York town yeah but you bought the
car in Miami. Now that you bought the

503
00:53:13,27 --> 00:53:14,36
insurance we're going to have

504
00:53:14,37 --> 00:53:20,07
a transfer to cancel what kind of
insurance you have Mr Haskell. When.

505
00:53:21,58 --> 00:53:28,01
I don't have people there. I don't see any
Surely you know what type of insurance

506
00:53:28,02 --> 00:53:33,88
you carry in the car the name of the company.
Yeah but well if you'll just tell me

507
00:53:33,89 --> 00:53:37,21
the name of the company I'd be very glad
to take care of all the details but we'll

508
00:53:37,22 --> 00:53:42,46
look for something perhaps not you know
well dome to my maps out and when I'm an

509
00:53:42,71 --> 00:53:47,20
asshole come on what's the matter change
your mind yes I'm sorry I guess I have

510
00:53:47,37 --> 00:53:48,27
a very let's go.

511
00:53:54,88 --> 00:53:55,32
Got me out of

512
00:53:55,33 --> 00:53:59,42
a tight spot but I still don't understand
all this you know well the minute I

513
00:53:59,43 --> 00:54:00,08
almost threw away

514
00:54:00,09 --> 00:54:04,14
a gold mine eight hundred fifty isn't to
be sneezed at the car doesn't look for as

515
00:54:04,15 --> 00:54:08,36
much as I thought when I'm selling
a car you want to keep it now wait

516
00:54:08,37 --> 00:54:11,30
a minute girl you said yourself I wouldn't
be safe until the car was in someone

517
00:54:11,31 --> 00:54:14,25
else's name and I could be free of
this mess when I go that's just

518
00:54:14,26 --> 00:54:19,43
a graphics you're not going. To drive at
the next car have fallen and we're going

519
00:54:19,44 --> 00:54:23,64
to mighty Now explain what is another
one of your brilliant ideas.

520
00:54:30,16 --> 00:54:31,69
Oh if you can I make mine

521
00:54:31,70 --> 00:54:38,21
a ham sandwich and coffee and do you think
oh I don't care the same. Thing that you

522
00:54:38,22 --> 00:54:45,17
don't. Get this fair I've been

523
00:54:45,18 --> 00:54:49,07
pretty patient so far I've done everything
you ask me to do but no more shut up

524
00:54:49,61 --> 00:54:53,17
you've taken Haskell's money you can have
the dough we get from selling the car but

525
00:54:53,18 --> 00:54:55,88
you're not going to keep me a prisoner
It's a good thing I bought the paper take

526
00:54:55,89 --> 00:54:57,56
a lot of facts there I'm in no married.

527
00:55:09,15 --> 00:55:14,10
No kids no I want to excuse you will you
think I'm crazy it's impossible I tell.

528
00:55:15,33 --> 00:55:22,29
Scuse me. All don't

529
00:55:22,30 --> 00:55:29,11
want to get through. No one could possibly
get away with an act like that be

530
00:55:29,12 --> 00:55:29,60
wise to me in

531
00:55:29,61 --> 00:55:33,31
a minute don't think you. You look enough
like the same coloring in the same

532
00:55:33,32 --> 00:55:37,16
building see I was close fits the
can you almost had me fooled for

533
00:55:37,17 --> 00:55:39,27
a while I'll grow up there where you think

534
00:55:39,28 --> 00:55:43,09
a father knows his own son and they must
be other relatives don't have to know you

535
00:55:43,30 --> 00:55:47,25
well Wally gives up the ghost he's an old
geezer any will pull through and as far

536
00:55:47,26 --> 00:55:50,58
out of the letters are concerned they have
him saying in fifteen or twenty years.

537
00:55:52,79 --> 00:55:58,07
I'm not hungry. And I won't do it it's not
as tough as it sounds remember you've

538
00:55:58,08 --> 00:55:58,94
got all kinds of bit of

539
00:55:58,95 --> 00:56:01,81
a Geisha in his car letters like I
could never get away with it it's

540
00:56:01,82 --> 00:56:05,97
a stupid thing I've ever heard the old
boy had scads of gold look in the paper

541
00:56:05,98 --> 00:56:09,81
their personal fortune assessed over
fifteen million he'll leave plenty of time

542
00:56:10,37 --> 00:56:14,63
maybe cut off his son how do we know it's
Oprah I want have anything to do with it

543
00:56:14,63 --> 00:56:21,42
. I think you will. Appear I'll
do anything within reason but not

544
00:56:21,43 --> 00:56:26,12
that so forget it find yourself
another stooge July second. Build

545
00:56:26,13 --> 00:56:29,25
a fix for the rest your life is Charlie
Haskell you can take your inheritance and

546
00:56:29,26 --> 00:56:32,64
go away from my whining about the reckless
weapons scheme and wondering where your

547
00:56:32,65 --> 00:56:36,92
next meal is coming from Think about that
Robert's Vera please you're talking to

548
00:56:36,93 --> 00:56:41,17
learn how to find this on spec and take
it with you show why not but both alike

549
00:56:41,30 --> 00:56:45,32
both born the same God I can take it easy
for people around here you know you talk

550
00:56:45,32 --> 00:56:51,81
. We'll be free to tell man has closed and
you show him thank you met in New York

551
00:56:51,82 --> 00:56:57,88
it was sick. No suppose he doesn't die
I know you well something tells me.

552
00:57:00,85 --> 00:57:02,79
But as much as I insisted
I would have no part of

553
00:57:02,80 --> 00:57:08,86
a scheme there was taking it for granted I
would. Neither of us got our mind on the

554
00:57:08,87 --> 00:57:13,62
cards we played that night. I knew or just
trying to kill time between newspaper

555
00:57:13,63 --> 00:57:15,59
editions. This was

556
00:57:15,60 --> 00:57:21,85
a death watch we're here. Maybe it was for
me too but you realize if I'm caught I

557
00:57:21,86 --> 00:57:24,08
want to know where I got the
car and stuff and I have me on

558
00:57:24,09 --> 00:57:28,81
a murder charge Yes Mark you won't get
caught trying not to step in if I'm caught

559
00:57:28,82 --> 00:57:35,71
and she realize you'll be off to. A
team plans to give me thirty. How

560
00:57:35,72 --> 00:57:38,46
will I be out if you'll be out eight hundred
fifty dollars would have gotten on the

561
00:57:38,47 --> 00:57:41,95
car really very early and often champions
who we don't and don't want to design

562
00:57:41,96 --> 00:57:45,27
a long shot let me sell the bus tomorrow
with the money it'll bring in what you've

563
00:57:45,28 --> 00:57:45,68
already got

564
00:57:45,69 --> 00:57:48,75
a clever kid like you can run it up in no
time and then we'd both be in the clear

565
00:57:49,09 --> 00:57:56,04
in the clear anyway and maybe maybe if I
go to court. I could couldn't swear to

566
00:57:56,05 --> 00:58:01,81
you you mean you'd squeal well no I'm not
squealing seven I liked him and. Even if

567
00:58:01,82 --> 00:58:03,42
he did tell the cops I was in on

568
00:58:03,43 --> 00:58:08,35
a lithium What did they do that made their
mind give me the same medicine they gave

569
00:58:08,36 --> 00:58:14,42
you. My lady.

570
00:58:17,72 --> 00:58:22,31
Will be rational All right I think the
eight hundred fifty of those you kick

571
00:58:22,32 --> 00:58:27,62
yourself on the block going away from you
take that chance. One another during your

572
00:58:27,63 --> 00:58:31,16
being a grown man that's why people wind
up behind the eight ball once they get

573
00:58:31,17 --> 00:58:36,59
a few dollars to become greedy and one
more. Season though you know that Roman

574
00:58:36,60 --> 00:58:40,25
general he got his for being greedy he
wasn't satisfied with the final wind up was

575
00:58:40,26 --> 00:58:43,18
he took the count a couple
of days ago you didn't have

576
00:58:43,19 --> 00:58:45,83
a dime of what you were so broke
you couldn't pay case for

577
00:58:45,84 --> 00:58:49,36
a postage stamp now you've got almost
seven hundred dollars with eight hundred

578
00:58:49,37 --> 00:58:53,13
fifty in the offing take my advice don't
try for more and I'm tired of his game

579
00:58:53,14 --> 00:58:56,55
let's have some blackjack and play solitaire
OK I want to live that's the way you

580
00:58:56,56 --> 00:59:00,22
feel about it so why are people getting so
on the wrong things want out much rabbit

581
00:59:00,45 --> 00:59:02,49
I'm really doing you a
favor I'll be out of

582
00:59:02,50 --> 00:59:06,25
a jam I keep my mouth shut I show you how
to make some soft money and what they

583
00:59:06,29 --> 00:59:10,03
still I get Thanks I would rather call
the cops I'm telling you kill the man I

584
00:59:10,04 --> 00:59:14,20
stole I did not immediately guess you
did or didn't you know I do. And then.

585
00:59:17,26 --> 00:59:23,33
Suppose I call the cops here and as in
What do you got to be scared of OK girl of

586
00:59:23,34 --> 00:59:26,17
the month go ahead and call them see
it right here at least they'll give me

587
00:59:26,18 --> 00:59:31,69
a square deal you want me to call you heard
me and I want to know if I'm in. You

588
00:59:31,70 --> 00:59:37,04
wouldn't see that to help me if I try and
get even with you you wouldn't take it to

589
00:59:37,05 --> 00:59:43,14
can you know and try to
see. Yeah. OK I will.

590
00:59:56,66 --> 01:00:01,27
And I'm Asian. I want the number
of the Hollywood police station.

591
01:00:03,60 --> 01:00:10,44
OK I got it thanks. But it you
wouldn't do that well wouldn't

592
01:00:10,45 --> 01:00:14,33
that now show you if I would take it easy
now let's talk this over this was early

593
01:00:14,34 --> 01:00:20,35
in the evening and the conversation while
hectic was at least pitched low. But as

594
01:00:20,36 --> 01:00:22,81
the minutes passed and more obstacles to

595
01:00:22,82 --> 01:00:27,70
a plan popped into my head the air got
to move each word coming from our lips

596
01:00:27,71 --> 01:00:28,24
cracked like

597
01:00:28,25 --> 01:00:33,15
a whip. I reminded her that as Charles
Haskell I didn't even know my mother's name

598
01:00:33,80 --> 01:00:38,35
where I had gone to school the name of my
best friend whether I had an aunt M.R.

599
01:00:38,36 --> 01:00:41,43
Not my religion and if I had ever owned

600
01:00:41,44 --> 01:00:46,61
a dog I didn't even know what my middle
initial stood for. I also pointed out that

601
01:00:46,62 --> 01:00:47,45
the real Haskell had

602
01:00:47,46 --> 01:00:52,37
a scar on his forearm his people never saw
gets Garrido me to run away right after

603
01:00:52,38 --> 01:00:55,62
but not the kids I know but his father
knew he was cut out to be some kind of

604
01:00:55,63 --> 01:01:02,13
a market so. There will be
I'll find my morning's papers

605
01:01:02,51 --> 01:01:04,32
anyway you would cut yourself

606
01:01:04,33 --> 01:01:10,74
a little cut he kept. You on that can I
don't I can't crack my leg off you drunken

607
01:01:10,75 --> 01:01:14,49
you're crazy mad Turman if you want to but
I won't get mixed up on this side how do

608
01:01:14,50 --> 01:01:16,44
we know has caused such a phony It wasn't

609
01:01:16,45 --> 01:01:20,81
a man so I don't know maybe just dreamed
it up wound early on and you know the

610
01:01:20,85 --> 01:01:24,26
dream when the lock on
the shoulder and it is

611
01:01:24,27 --> 01:01:29,22
a cute little gas chamber waiting for you
Robin and I hear it's tradition there is

612
01:01:29,23 --> 01:01:36,04
no mother. Wait. There are I want to see

613
01:01:36,74 --> 01:01:43,67
police. Tape do you think you'll
learn I'll let you alone your

614
01:01:43,68 --> 01:01:46,12
promise to leave the phone worried if you're
drunk you don't know what you're doing

615
01:01:46,82 --> 01:01:47,14
me

616
01:01:47,15 --> 01:01:55,53
a promise. You

617
01:01:55,90 --> 01:02:01,63
know me. I'm sorry but that's how near
opened up the window it's not high Don't

618
01:02:01,67 --> 01:02:07,90
count on me not do you want to do I
do want to. Hear no sermons Hey yeah.

619
01:02:09,16 --> 01:02:10,62
All right I'll open up the window.

620
01:02:20,41 --> 01:02:24,31
Open the door please open the door to open
the door don't use the phone listen to

621
01:02:24,32 --> 01:02:27,50
me I don't like you Robert you know

622
01:02:27,51 --> 01:02:33,67
a gentleman saying he had my hand and I'm
going to get even with you if you don't

623
01:02:33,68 --> 01:02:38,13
open the door I'm going to kick it down
Vera No I don't call the cops listen to me

624
01:02:38,22 --> 01:02:44,04
do anything you say they're not
let me on. How bright the pony.

625
01:03:03,71 --> 01:03:03,86
With.

626
01:03:22,51 --> 01:03:29,45
The world is full of skeptics. I want
myself. In the Haskell business how

627
01:03:29,46 --> 01:03:32,80
many of you would believe you fell out of
the car now after killing Vera without

628
01:03:32,81 --> 01:03:37,71
really meaning to do it how many of you
would believe it wasn't premeditated. In

629
01:03:37,72 --> 01:03:41,93
a jury room every last man of you would
go down shouting that she had me over

630
01:03:41,94 --> 01:03:48,84
a barrel and I only I was
force. The room was still. So

631
01:03:48,85 --> 01:03:49,53
quiet that for

632
01:03:49,54 --> 01:03:54,43
a while they're going to divide suddenly
gone deaf. It was pure fear of course now

633
01:03:54,44 --> 01:04:01,36
is hysterical. But they can use.
Their was dead. And that was their

634
01:04:01,37 --> 01:04:08,31
murder. MARGARET What an awful word
that is but I've become one and to not

635
01:04:08,32 --> 01:04:12,91
get caught. What evidence there was around
the place had to be destroyed from the

636
01:04:12,92 --> 01:04:16,32
looks of things there was plenty looking
around the room and things with blood was

637
01:04:16,33 --> 01:04:17,37
like looking into the faces of

638
01:04:17,38 --> 01:04:21,25
a hundred people had seen us together and
who remembered me. This was the kind of

639
01:04:21,26 --> 01:04:27,72
testimony I couldn't rub out. No. I could
burn clothes and hide bottles for the

640
01:04:27,73 --> 01:04:32,56
next five years and always be witnesses the
man made for one she could identify me

641
01:04:32,57 --> 01:04:35,21
the car dealer the waitress in the drive
and the girl in the dress shop and the guy

642
01:04:35,22 --> 01:04:41,88
in the liquor store and ticket on
identifying me. And I was cooked down for

643
01:04:42,57 --> 01:04:46,34
I had to get out of there.
By one side remained beside

644
01:04:46,35 --> 01:04:50,92
a dead body and carefully how to avoid
being accused of killing him this time I

645
01:04:50,93 --> 01:04:57,36
couldn't. This time and was
killed if. You look at. That.

646
01:04:58,88 --> 01:04:59,18
I was like

647
01:04:59,19 --> 01:05:03,72
a guy suffering from shock things were
going around in my head I couldn't make

648
01:05:03,73 --> 01:05:07,40
myself think right. All I could
think of was the guy with

649
01:05:07,41 --> 01:05:13,03
a saxophone and he was playing.
It was no love song and. It was

650
01:05:13,04 --> 01:05:53,95
a church. News

651
01:05:53,95 --> 01:05:53,95
.

652
01:06:02,00 --> 01:06:08,67
Of my problems one song. I had to stay away
from New York for all time. Because our

653
01:06:08,68 --> 01:06:13,12
robbers was left to this death and had to
stay there. And I could never go back to

654
01:06:13,13 --> 01:06:19,90
Hollywood someone might recognize
me as Haskell. Then too there was

655
01:06:19,91 --> 01:06:23,39
still. I could never go to her with

656
01:06:23,40 --> 01:06:29,57
a thing like this hanging over my head
all I could do was pray she'd be happy.

657
01:06:41,27 --> 01:06:46,12
I was in Bakersfield before I read that
girl's body was discovered that the police

658
01:06:46,13 --> 01:06:51,14
were looking for Haskell in connection
with his wife's murder. Isn't that

659
01:06:51,15 --> 01:06:57,29
a laugh. ASCO got me into this mess and
Haskell was getting me out of it the police

660
01:06:57,30 --> 01:06:57,87
were searching for

661
01:06:57,88 --> 01:07:05,96
a dead man. I keep trying to
forget what happened. And

662
01:07:05,97 --> 01:07:12,79
wonder what my life might have been if that
car of Escalus hadn't stopped. But one

663
01:07:12,80 --> 01:07:19,56
thing I don't have to wonder
about. I know. Someday I will

664
01:07:19,57 --> 01:07:21,42
stop to pick me up but I never bump.

665
01:07:26,53 --> 01:07:33,53
Yes. Fate. Or some mysterious
force and put the finger on you

666
01:07:33,54 --> 01:07:36,64
or me. For no good reason at all.
